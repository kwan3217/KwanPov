/// Experimental patch providing a mechanism to persist data between frames in an animation.

///
/// @note     This patch will also persist data between successive renders in a GUI.
///           Currently, no mechanism has been implemented to force cleanup of persistent data from the GUI.
///           Cleanup from SDL can be achieved using the @c #undef statement.
